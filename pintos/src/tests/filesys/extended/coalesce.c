/*
Test your buffer cacheâ€™s ability to coalesce writes to the same sector. Each block device keeps
a read_cnt counter and a write_cnt counter. Write a large file byte-by-byte (make the total
file size at least 64KB, which is twice the maximum allowed buffer cache size). Then, read it in
byte-by-byte. The total number of device writes should be on the order of 128 (because 64KB is
128 blocks).
